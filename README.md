Website for Purdue's College of Science Ambassadors

## What's going on? ##
Our dear leader, John, wants to make a (new) website for the science ambassadors. 
<br />
He wants to the site to look something like this: 
<br />
 - http://www.atlanticbt.com/employees.php
 
 The idea is to have a grid of ambassadors' profiles - on the rollover, you can see a little blurb.
 <br />
 Also, you can select other kinds of information (like on the website)

## About the Repo ##
As of now - the repo is organized as such:
=======
I don't really know, but it's a website. John want's it to use PHP and stuff.

 - index.php - the home page, using php for future php functionality
 - assets - contains sub folders:
 	- css - css files
	- imgs 
		- icons
		- profiles
		- sprites
	- js - javascript
 - other pages (where links will go to (probably add some dummy ones soon))
